# The Elm Architecture in Swift

This is sample code, and not at all production-ready. It's a proof-of-concept, it seems to work well and I don't think there are major roadblocks (except adding all of UIKit to the virtual views layer).

Open the workspace, and look at the playgrounds. It shows some examples. (Even though the playgrounds currently don't seem to run).

Then go to AppDelegate, and run one of the three apps (uncomment the right lines to run one of them).

This is part of an upcoming project I'm working on, and I am planning to write up documentation for usage and implementation (at some point).

Enjoy!
